# Mokujin

Mokujin is a discord bot that fetches Tekken 7 framedata.  
It uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v1.0.1 and is updated to use Python 3.6+

Some work has gone into it and it now works quite well, let's call it version 0.7
All of the main functionalities have been implemented and work, and it doesn't crash very often anymore.
Framedata acquired from RBNorway, lot of help and inspiration [hanyaa's TkPublic bot](https://github.com/hanyaah/TkPublic).

On 2019-04-17 the project was migrated to discord.py rewrite (v1.0). 

## If you want to use this:

Clone this to a linux server that has Python 3.6.0+ with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.
You need your own discord bot ([here's how](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)) and have the token in a token.txt file in the same directory.
The executable is mokujin.py.
