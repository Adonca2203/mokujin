# Mokujin

Mokujin is a discord bot that fetches Tekken 7 framedata.  
It uses discord.py and is updated to use Python 3.6.4

Some work has gone into it and it now works quite well, let's call it version 0.5.
All of the main functionalities have been implemented and work, and now it should also be more stable.
Framedata acquired from RBNorway, lot of help and inspiration [hanyaa's TkPublic bot](https://github.com/hanyaah/TkPublic).
