# Mokujin

Mokujin is a discord bot that fetches Tekken 7 framedata.  
It uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and is updated to use Python 3.6.4

Some work has gone into it and it now works quite well, let's call it version 0.5.
All of the main functionalities have been implemented and work, and now it should also be more stable.
Framedata acquired from RBNorway, lot of help and inspiration [hanyaa's TkPublic bot](https://github.com/hanyaah/TkPublic).

I'll start on the work to have this converted to discord.py rewrite (v1.0+)

## If you want to use this:

Clone this to a linux server that has Python 3.6.0+ with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.
You need your own discord bot ([here's how](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)) and have the token in a token.txt file in the same directory.
The executable is mokujin.py.
