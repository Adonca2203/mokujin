# Mokujin

Mokujin is a discord bot that fetches Tekken 7 framedata.  
It uses discord.py and is programmed with Python 3.4.3

You could say it is in its barebones release stage, let's call it version 0.1.
The features are few and far between, but the actual showing of frame data works.
Framedata acquired from RBNorway, lot of help and inspiration [hanyaa's TkPublic bot](https://github.com/hanyaah/TkPublic).

I plan to later on also add markov chain chatbot functionalities.
